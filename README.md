# Heart-Disease-UCI---Diagnosis-and-Prediction

Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decisions and predictions.

In this project, I have applied Machine Learning approaches(and eventually comparing them) for classifying whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, using one of the most used dataset â€” Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Repository.

Classification Models-
1) Logistic Regression
2) KNN Classification
3) Decision Trees
4) Random Forests
5) Boosted Trees
